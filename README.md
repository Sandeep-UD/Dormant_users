# GitHub Dormant Users Report

This script identifies dormant users in GitHub organizations by analyzing their activity across all repositories.

This project is available both as:
- ✅ **A GitHub Action**
- 🐍 **A standalone Python script (optional local usage)**

---

## 🚀 GitHub Action (Marketplace)

Run dormant user audits automatically using **GitHub Actions**, without local setup.

## How It Works

- Retrieves all repositories and branches for the configured GitHub organization.
- Collects user activity from commits, issues, and pull requests.
- Determines each user’s most recent activity date across the organization.
- Classifies users as:
  - `active=true` if activity is within the configured inactivity threshold
  - `active=false` if activity exceeds the threshold
  - `never-active` if no activity is detected
- Generates a CSV report summarizing user activity status.

### Example workflow

```yaml
name: Dormant Users Audit

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 2 1 * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Dormant Users Report
        uses: your-org/github-dormant-users-action@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.ORG_AUDIT_TOKEN }}
          org_names: my-org,subsidiary-org
          days_inactive_threshold: 90

      - name: Upload dormant users report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dormant-users-report
          path: "*.csv"

```

## 🔐 Required Token Permissions

The token used with this action must have the following scopes:

- `read:org – to list organization members`
- `repo - to analyze repository activity`


## 🔧 GitHub Action Inputs

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `github_token` | Yes | – | GitHub token with `read:org` and repository read access |
| `org_names` | Yes | – | Comma-separated GitHub organization names |
| `days_inactive_threshold` | No | `60` | Days to consider a user inactive |


## Sample Output

| Users              | Last activity | Active      |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| dependabot         | 2014-04-25    | false       |
| sriplayground      | 2024-01-25    | false       |
| balajisriramdas    | 2025-12-31    | true        |
| aliqaryan          | 2022-10-28    | false       |
| vaishnavn02        | 2024-01-25    | false       |
| smolz              | 2021-12-21    | false       |
| naveen-kunder      | 25-12-31      | true        |
| akshay-canarys     | N/A           | never-active|




## 🐍 Standalone Python Script (Optional Local Usage)

## Overview

The script tracks user activity including:
- Commits to branches
- Issue creation and updates
- Pull request creation and updates

It generates a CSV report showing each user's last activity date and whether they're active, inactive, or have never been active.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- GitHub Personal Access Token with permissions:
  - `read:org` (read organization data)
  - `repo` (read repository data)

## Installation

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your settings:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
ORG_NAMES=org1,org2,org3
DAYS_INACTIVE_THRESHOLD=60
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Personal Access Token | Required | `ghp_xxxxx` |
| `ORG_NAMES` | Comma-separated list of organizations | Required | `myorg,anotherorg` |
| `DAYS_INACTIVE_THRESHOLD` | Days to consider user inactive | `60` | `90` |


## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python dormant_users.py
```

## Output

### Console Progress

The script displays real-time progress:

```
🔍 Fetching repos for organization: myorg
📦 Total repositories found in myorg: 145

📄 Writing CSV -> user_activity_report_myorg_20241124_153045.csv
✅ Done with myorg
```

### CSV Report: `user_activity_report_[ORG]_[TIMESTAMP].csv`

Generated report includes:

```csv
Users,Last activity,active
john-doe,24-11-15,true
jane-smith,24-10-10,false
bob-jones,24-11-20,true
alice-inactive,24-08-01,false
new-user,N/A,never-active
```

#### CSV Columns

| Column | Description | Values |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `Users` | GitHub username | `username` |
| `Last activity` | Date of last activity (YY-MM-DD) | `24-11-15` or `N/A` |
| `active` | Activity status | `true`, `false`, or `never-active` |

### Activity Status

- **`true`**: User has activity within the threshold period (default: 60 days)
- **`false`**: User has activity but it's older than the threshold
- **`never-active`**: User is an org member but has no tracked activity

## Features

- ✅ Multi-organization support (process multiple orgs in one run)
- 🔍 Comprehensive activity tracking (commits, issues, PRs)
- 🌿 Scans all branches in all repositories
- 👥 Identifies never-active organization members
- 📊 Timestamped CSV reports for each organization
- 🔄 Built-in rate limit protection
- ⏸️ Periodic delays to avoid API throttling
- 📈 Real-time progress feedback

## How It Works

1. **Load Configuration**: Reads token, organizations, and threshold from `.env`
2. **For Each Organization**:
   - Fetches all repositories using GraphQL API
   - For each repository:
     - Gets all branches
     - For each branch:
       - Collects commits since threshold date
       - Collects issue activity
       - Collects PR activity
     - Tracks the most recent activity per user
   - Fetches all organization members
   - Identifies members with no tracked activity
3. **Generate Report**: Creates CSV with activity status for each user
4. **Rate Limiting**: Adds delays every 100 repositories

## Activity Tracking Details

### Commits
- Tracks commits on all branches
- Uses commit author date
- Only counts commits since threshold date

### Issues
- Tracks issue creation and updates
- Uses `updatedAt` timestamp
- Includes all issue activity

### Pull Requests
- Tracks PRs (open, closed, merged)
- Uses `updatedAt` timestamp
- Includes all PR activity

## Performance Considerations

- **Large Organizations**: Processing can take significant time for orgs with many repos
- **Rate Limits**: Script includes built-in delays (2 seconds per 100 repos)
- **GraphQL API**: Uses GraphQL for efficient bulk data retrieval
- **Pagination**: Automatically handles paginated results

## Use Cases

- 📊 **License Auditing**: Identify inactive users consuming licenses
- 🔐 **Security Review**: Find accounts that haven't been used recently
- 👥 **User Management**: Determine which accounts can be offboarded
- 📈 **Activity Metrics**: Track organization engagement levels
- 💰 **Cost Optimization**: Reclaim licenses from dormant accounts

## Customizing Thresholds

Adjust the inactivity threshold based on your needs:

```env
# 30 days (1 month)
DAYS_INACTIVE_THRESHOLD=30

# 90 days (3 months)
DAYS_INACTIVE_THRESHOLD=90

# 180 days (6 months)
DAYS_INACTIVE_THRESHOLD=180

# 365 days (1 year)
DAYS_INACTIVE_THRESHOLD=365
```

## Processing Multiple Organizations

Process multiple organizations in one run:

```env
ORG_NAMES=org1,org2,org3,org4
```

Each organization gets its own timestamped CSV report.

## Troubleshooting

### "Please set ORG_NAMES in your .env file"
Add `ORG_NAMES` to your `.env` file with at least one organization.

### "GraphQL query returned errors"
- Verify your token has the correct permissions (`read:org`, `repo`)
- Check that organization names are spelled correctly
- Ensure you have access to the organizations

### Rate Limit Issues
The script includes automatic rate limit handling, but if you encounter issues:
- Increase the sleep duration in the code
- Process fewer organizations at once
- Use a GitHub App token (higher rate limits)

### Slow Performance
For organizations with many repositories:
- Run during off-peak hours
- Process one organization at a time
- Consider filtering repositories if possible

### "Skipping branch due to error"
- Empty branches or protected branches may cause errors
- The script continues processing other branches
- Check specific error messages for details

## Interpreting Results

### High Percentage of Inactive Users
- Review onboarding/offboarding processes
- Consider implementing automatic account reviews
- Verify threshold is appropriate for your organization

### Users Marked "never-active"
- May be recently added members
- Could be accounts waiting for project assignment
- Might be external collaborators with limited access
- Consider manual review for these accounts

### All Users Showing as Active
- Threshold might be too long
- Organization may be highly engaged
- Verify script is scanning all repositories

## Best Practices

- 🔄 **Run Regularly**: Schedule monthly or quarterly reports
- 📊 **Track Trends**: Compare reports over time
- 👥 **Review Before Action**: Manually verify before removing access
- 📝 **Document Policy**: Define clear inactivity policies
- 🔐 **Secure Output**: CSV files contain user lists - handle securely
- ⏰ **Off-Peak Runs**: Run during low-usage periods to reduce impact

## Limitations

- **Activity Types**: Only tracks commits, issues, and PRs (not code reviews, comments, reactions)
- **API Visibility**: Can only see activity in accessible repositories
- **Private Activity**: Private contributions may not be fully tracked
- **Historical Data**: GraphQL history queries may have limitations
- **Deleted Content**: Activity on deleted branches/repos not tracked
